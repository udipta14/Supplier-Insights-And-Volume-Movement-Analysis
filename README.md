**Title: Power BI Project - Supplier Insights and Volume Analysis**<br><br>

**Introduction:**<br>
I recently worked on a Power BI project aimed at providing actionable insights to the Procurement Department by analyzing invoice data, supplier capabilities, and procurement trends. This project involved three datasets: Invoice Data, Material Weights and Sources, and Supplier Data, each contributing to different aspects of the analysis.<br>

**Dashboard 1: Supplier Overview**<br>
*Objective:*<br>
The "Supplier Overview" dashboard focuses on assessing the status and capabilities of suppliers. It helps Purchase Groups (Buyers) gain quick insights into supplier categorizations and capabilities.

*Key Features:*<br>
1. **Supplier Status:** The dashboard presents a summary of supplier status based on the provided data, categorizing them into 'Go' (for growth) and 'NoGo' (not to grow) based on their strategic status with the company.
2. **Commodity Distribution:** It visually represents the distribution of suppliers into Non-Ferrous and Ferrous categories.
3. **MSME Classification:** The dashboard displays the classification of suppliers into Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises based on their turnover.
4. **Capabilities:** We've highlighted whether suppliers have capabilities in Metal Casting and Metal Machining, helping buyers assess potential suppliers for specific manufacturing needs.
5. **Payment Terms:** The dashboard provides insights into payment release terms with suppliers, aiding financial planning and cash flow management.

**Dashboard 2: Volume Movement**<br>
*Objective:*<br>
The "Volume Movement" dashboard allows users to analyze purchase volume and tonnage volume trends over different years for historical comparisons and future business planning. It provides various filtering options for granular analysis.

*Key Features:*<br>
1. **Yearly Volume Trends:** A line chart visualizes the yearly movement of purchase volume, enabling users to track procurement trends.
2. **Yearly Tonnage Trends:** Another line chart showcases the yearly tonnage volume trends, which are crucial for supply chain planning.
3. **Business Unit Filter:** Users can filter data by Business Unit, providing insights specific to different manufacturing plants and units.
4. **Purchasing Group Filter:** This filter enables users to focus on the contributions of specific purchasing groups within the organization.
5. **Manufacturing Plant Filter:** Users can drill down into the performance of different manufacturing plants.
6. **Part Family Filter:** This filter helps analyze procurement trends for specific part families.
7. **Supplier Name Filter:** It allows users to explore the performance of individual suppliers.
8. **Raw Material Filter:** Users can analyze trends separately for Aluminum and Ferrous parts, which often have distinct procurement patterns.

**Conclusion:**<br>
In summary, our Power BI project successfully addresses the complex procurement challenges faced by the company. The "Supplier Overview" dashboard provides quick insights into supplier status and capabilities, aiding the Purchase Department in strategic decision-making. Meanwhile, the "Volume Movement" dashboard offers a comprehensive analysis of purchase and tonnage volume trends, allowing for historical comparisons and future business planning. The combination of these dashboards equips the organization with the tools needed to make data-driven supply chain strategic decisions.

These dashboards provide valuable insights to stakeholders and empower them to optimize procurement processes, minimize costs, and enhance supplier relationships for sustained business growth.<br><br>
